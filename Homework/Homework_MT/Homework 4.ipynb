    "3) This problem is going to require some irl work. As I would hope you are all aware, when you blow into a glass bottle, it makes a sound and you can change that sound by the size of the bottle or by how much liquid is left in the bottle. This is due to a phenomenon known as Helmholtz Resonance. For a given helmholtz resonator, the resonance frequency is given by the equation:\n",
    "$$ f_r = \\frac{v_s}{2\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{VL_e}} $$\n",
    "where $v_s$ is the speed of sound in air (343 m/s), $A$ is the area of the opening of your resonator, $V$ is the volume of the resonator, and $L_e$ is the effective length of the neck with the opening. Explicitly, $Le = L + α\\sqrt(A)$ with L being the physical length of the neck and α ≈ 0.96."

Next, find a bottle to be your helmholtz resonator. Measure its dimensions carefully and, using the equation above, predict the resonance frequency of your bottle. Use your notebook as your calculator and make sure you define all your variables."
